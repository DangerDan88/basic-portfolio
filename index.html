            my name is Daniel I am 23 years old and currently studying to become a full stack web developer. I have
            always been interested in computers whether it be with video games or computer games.
            I figured the best way to be able to accomplish this was with some schooling to be able to get my foot in
            the door at my first tech job. I enjoy working out and doing just about anything active. Some fun facts
            about me would be I have 12 animals living at my house so it definitely gets a little crazy.
